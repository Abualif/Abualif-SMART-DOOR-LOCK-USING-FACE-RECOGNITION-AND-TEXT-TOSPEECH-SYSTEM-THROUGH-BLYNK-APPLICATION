# Smart Door Lock with Face Recognition, Blynk, and Text-to-Speech

This project is an **IoT-based Smart Door Lock** that uses an ESP32-CAM to perform **local face recognition**, **control a solenoid lock**, and provide **real-time monitoring and notifications** via the **Blynk** application and a web dashboard.

## üìã Overview

The system improves door security by replacing conventional keys with face recognition. Registered faces are stored locally, and the door unlocks only when a registered face is detected. It also provides audio feedback through browser-based **text-to-speech**, live camera streaming, and remote control via smartphone.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Local face detection and recognition on ESP32-CAM
- ‚úÖ Real-time video streaming on web dashboard and Blynk
- ‚úÖ Automatic door unlocking with solenoid lock and relay
- ‚úÖ Manual control and notifications via Blynk mobile app
- ‚úÖ Audio notification (text-to-speech) in browser when door opens
- ‚úÖ Public remote access enabled with VPS and Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)

## üñ•Ô∏è System Components

- **ESP32-CAM**: Main controller for face recognition, streaming, and WebSocket server
- **Relay module**: Controls the solenoid lock
- **Solenoid lock**: Electromechanical actuator for locking/unlocking the door
- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: Hosts FRP server for public access
- **FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)**: Enables stable internet access from outside the local network
- **Blynk app**: Mobile app for remote monitoring, control, and notifications
- **Web dashboard**: For face registration, streaming, and control

## üöÄ How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ User face is registered through the web dashboard and stored locally on ESP32-CAM.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ ESP32-CAM continuously monitors and detects faces through its camera.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ If a registered face is detected, ESP32-CAM sends a signal via relay to unlock the solenoid lock.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The system sends a real-time notification to the user via Blynk and plays an audio confirmation (text-to-speech) in the browser.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Video streaming and manual control are accessible via the dashboard or Blynk app.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ VPS and FRP make the dashboard and ESP32-CAM accessible remotely.

## üìñ Usage

1. Flash the ESP32-CAM with the provided firmware.
2. Set up your VPS and configure FRP for tunneling.
3. Deploy the web dashboard files to your server.
4. Connect ESP32-CAM to WiFi, start the server, and register user faces.
5. Use the dashboard or Blynk app to monitor, control, and receive notifications.
