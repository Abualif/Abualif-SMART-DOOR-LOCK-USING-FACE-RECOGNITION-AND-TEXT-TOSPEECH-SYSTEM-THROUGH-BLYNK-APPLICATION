# Abualif-SMART-DOOR-LOCK-USING-FACE-RECOGNITION-AND-TEXT-TOSPEECH-SYSTEM-THROUGH-BLYNK-APPLICATION

This system is an IoT-based smart door lock built using an ESP32-CAM microcontroller as the core controller. The ESP32-CAM performs face detection and face recognition locally, utilizing its onboard face recognition library and real-time communication via WebSocket for streaming data and commands. User faces are registered through a web dashboard interface and stored in the ESP32-CAMâ€™s local memory. When a face is detected and recognized, the ESP32-CAM activates a relay to control a solenoid lock (an electromechanical actuator) to unlock the door. The system connects to a WiFi network and leverages Blynk as the platform for monitoring, notifications, and manual control via smartphone. Additionally, the system features browser-based text-to-speech audio notifications. For remote public access, the ESP32-CAM is connected to a VPS using Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), allowing the web dashboard and controls to remain accessible over the internet reliably
